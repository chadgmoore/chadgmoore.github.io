This morning I put a piece of toast in the toaster, and decided to try some mindful breathing exercises while it cooked. I figured instead of looking at my phone, I’d relax the mind a bit. I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing. Counting the breaths in and out, in and out. I guess it worked, because I sat relaxed and calm for some time, and didn’t even notice the burning smell.
