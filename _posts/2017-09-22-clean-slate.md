Now that I've committed to micro.blog and my old website as the domain name, I am leaving my previous writing sort-of abandoned on [Where the Light Gathers](http://wherethelightgathers.com). Maybe I'll move it over, or figure out that .htaccssesserssssasas (that's the correct spellling, right?) trick to forward it all. Maybe, someday.  

Or not. A fresh, clean slate is kinda nice to be honest.
