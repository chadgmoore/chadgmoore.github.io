			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/craigmcclellan\">Craig McClellan</a> and I had a brief discussion of the Panobook on <a href=\"micro.blog\">micro.blog</a>. I wanted to give him a longer response, and get my own thoughts in order for his question of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any thoughts on how you‚Äôre going to use it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve backed the <a href=\"https://www.studioneat.com/products/panobook\">Panobook</a> on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/panobook-a-notebook-for-your-desk\">Kickstarter</a>. I love the format of the notebook, I think it will be ideal sitting on the desk, next to the laptop. </p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm trying to get back into the habit of <a href=\"http://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/pinkcast-2-2-why-you-should-take-notes-by-hand/\">writing down notes</a>, versus typing them on a computer. I believe that writing allows me to synthesize, versus the transcribing that I fall into when typing. </p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve been using a modified <a href=\"http://bulletjournal.com/\">Bullet Journal</a> for the entire year (minus a 5 or 6 week gap). I don‚Äôt go all-in on that model, it‚Äôs mostly just notes and lists for the day, and rolling notes for each project I‚Äôm working on at work.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm hoping to use the Panobook for some side projects/ideas I‚Äôm trying to validate. I‚Äôll likely set it up like a bullet journal‚Äôs index and page numbering workflows. But I‚Äôll use it specifically for the project work, not day-to-day note taking. I‚Äôll use my moleskin bullet journal for work, and personal life, and the Panaobook for the side projects. A separation of concerns, if you will. </p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôll be writing feature lists, designing UX flows and screens, and various other project related notes. The one thing I‚Äôm most curious about is validating the ideas before committing to build them. Not sure if this or any notebook is designed for figuring that out, but I‚Äôll likely reserve some pages for validation flows of some kind. </p>\n",
